# Roblox Rare UserName Generator
Easy to use Roblox rare username generator

This is literally easy to use. ~~However the (very) bad part about this generator is that it can't detect if the username is filtered by Roblox or not. So most of the usernames that have been generated are filtered.~~ **FIXED**üòè

This generator also supports Discord Webhooks!
